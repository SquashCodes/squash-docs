# ðŸŒ‹ SQUASH VULCAN

**Squash Vulcan** is the most advanced protection core ever created for MTA servers. Built from scratch, it acts as an invisible layer between your server and any attempt at reverse engineering, debugging, modification, or unauthorized access to Squash files. Focused on securing you â€” our client â€” Vulcan is the ultimate answer to the protection challenges faced by MTA companies.

ðŸ”¥ **Vulcan doesnâ€™t just protect â€” it reacts.**
