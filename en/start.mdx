This step must be repeated for **ALL** products in your account. You need to configure each one the same way, including setting the IP for each on the WEBSITE.

# Video Tutorial

<video width="100%" height="400" controls>
  <source src="/videos/tutorial.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video element.

# Text Tutorial

## Step 1

The first thing you should do is go to our [WEBSITE](https://www.squashcodes.com) and log into your account by clicking **"Client Area"** in the upper right corner. Then, go to the **account settings** in the same corner, as shown below:

  className=""
  src="/images/tutorial/tutorial_1.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Next, look for **Manage Licenses** — this option is located just below your account name, as shown here:

<img
  className=""
  src="/images/tutorial/tutorial_2.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

You will now see a panel with all your licenses. Choose the product you want to assign an IP to and enter it in the field shown below:

<img
  className=""
  src="/images/tutorial/tutorial_3.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

### How to get the IP?

#### Hosted Server  
Just open your MTA, select your server from the server list, and copy the IP shown at the top, as in the example below:

<img
  className=""
  src="/images/tutorial/tutorial_4.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

#### Local Server  
Go to this [WEBSITE](https://www.squashcodes.com), copy the IP shown there, then get the port from your MTA. The final format will be:

SITE IP:MTA PORT

## Step 2

Now that you've added your IP on the site, it’s time to configure it inside the script. Stay in the **MANAGE LICENSES** panel.

Open the configuration file of your product, usually located inside a folder called `config`, named `main.lua` or `config.lua`. The first line should look like this:

```lua
license = {
    ["Email"] = "",
    ["Key"] = "",
}
```

Now fill in the fields **inside the quotes** `""`. You can get the KEY from the **MANAGE LICENSES** page on the website, as shown below:

<img
  className=""
  src="/images/tutorial/tutorial_5.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Your final config file should look like this:

```lua
license = {
    ["Email"] = "support@squashcodes.com",
    ["Key"] = "SQUASH-2020-2020",
}
```

If your product still doesn't start properly, we recommend that you open a ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XFfKTDF3ak) channel so we can assist you in the best way.

# Common Errors

#### getServerIpFromMasterServer

```
attempt to call global 'getServerIpFromMasterServer' (a nil value)
```

If this error appears when starting one of our products, you need to update your MTA server to the latest version, or any version **above 1.6.0 r22890**.

**Why does this error occur?**  
This function is a very recent addition to MTA, so your server may not yet be updated to support it.

### If you don’t know how to update, contact your HOSTING PROVIDER and ask them to update it for you.
